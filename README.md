Tinder Auto-Liker using Selenium

This project automates the liking process on Tinder using Python and Selenium WebDriver. It eliminates the need for manual interaction by automatically liking user profiles.

The script performs the following tasks:

Automates Facebook login for Tinder access.
Handles pop-ups, such as location access, cookie consent, and notifications.
Handles exceptions like NoSuchElementException and ElementClickInterceptedException effectively.
Clicks the Like button up to 100 times, respecting Tinder's daily limit for free users.
This project was a great opportunity to strengthen Selenium skills, especially in:

Browser automation
Exception handling
Working with dynamic elements and multi-window switching
